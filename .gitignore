# NOTES:
#
# Keeping .iml makes it easier for the cloner. Also recommended to keep.
#
# Not ignoring entire .idea makes it easier for the cloner (only ignore user specific content)
#
# Helpful notes for .gitignore in repository with multiple applications:
# A leading "**" followed by a slash means match in all directories. For example, "**/foo" matches file or directory "foo" anywhere
# "/**" matches everything inside. For example, "abc/**" matches all files inside directory "abc", relative to the location of the .gitignore file, with infinite depth.
# "a/**/b" matches "a/b", "a/x/b", "a/x/y/b" and so on.
